## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is crucial to ensure the software is delivered on schedule and project managers ensure deadlines are met by ensuring the design is consistent and that resources are assigned based on project needs and priorities.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control ensures optimal resource usage from human to financial and material. Assessing the probability and impact of risks and developing plans for high-priority risks can help prevent budget overruns.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodology emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback while waterfall methodology insists on completing each phase before the next begins. The main advantage of agile is it gives room for regular customer feedback while waterfall is easy to manage due to its rigidity. The disadvantage of agile is less predictability, while it's difficult to accommodate changes in waterfall.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile would benefit projects whose goals are not well defined such as a new website, while waterfall would benefit complex projects such as manufacturing and construction projects.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Use of product-oriented approach and focusing on preventing defects ensures quality assurance. Maintaining high standards reduces the risk of bugs, security vulnerabilities and consistency.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining project scope ensures the project is delivered on time and within the budget also meets the stakeholders needs and expectations. WBS is the breakdown of a big project into smaller components and it makes it easier to identify scope, cost and deliverables.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Developing a detailed project schedule helps complete the project within a specific timeframe and simplifies overall execution eventually leading to more successful project outcomes.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
My software aims to give global access to medics on patients information from previous diagonisis and treatment given. This problem is significant to my audience because it will rule out misdiagnosis and allow medics have accurate data of the patient regardless of where in the world they will be.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clearly defining the problem helps know where to begin in solving it and helps have a deeper understanding of its nature and scope.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
It allows one to be treated anywhere in the world without worries of information they could have forgotten especially with regards to previous medication taken and allergies to certain medicine.

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Access to data for authorized personell in the needed departments only.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Data available is the statistics given on how much misdiagnosis is done because of no access to previous records and the potential growth is big because everyone eventually will become a member in the database of my software.

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
Market trends especially in the healtcare industry would help me know the advancements so far in the field and where there is shortage and see how to accomodate it in my software or what has been done be adjusted or improved.
